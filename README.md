# Library Management System

## Project Overview

The Library Management System is a comprehensive software application designed to manage and automate various library operations. This system aims to provide an efficient way to handle user management, book management, borrowing processes, and more. It leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and TypeScript features to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.

## Features

### User Management
- **Admin and Member Roles**: Different permissions and functionalities for admins and members.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete user accounts.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure login system with role-based access control.

### Book Management
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage books, including adding new books, updating existing ones, and deleting books.
- **Categories and Genres**: Organize books by categories and genres.
- **Availability Status**: Track whether books are available, borrowed, or reserved.

### Borrowing System
- **Borrow and Return Books**: Manage the process of borrowing and returning books.
- **Due Dates and Fines**: Track due dates for borrowed books and calculate fines for late returns.

### Search and Filtering
- **Search Functionality**: Search for books by title, author, genre, etc.
- **Filtering Options**: Filter books by availability, category, and other criteria.

### Notification System
- **Due Date Reminders**: Notify members about upcoming due dates for borrowed books.
- **New Arrivals**: Inform members about new books added to the library.

## Key Concepts and TypeScript Features

### Classes and Interfaces
- Define classes for `User`, `Admin`, `Member`, `Book`, `Category`, and `Genre`.
- Use interfaces to enforce contracts and ensure type safety.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Implement inheritance to create specialized user roles (`Admin` and `Member`).
- Use polymorphism to handle different borrowing behaviors.

### Access Modifiers
- Utilize `public`, `private`, and `protected` access modifiers to encapsulate and protect data.

### Generics
- Implement generics for reusable components, such as lists and repositories.

### Modules and Namespaces
- Organize the codebase into modules and namespaces for better maintainability and clarity.

### Decorators
- Use decorators for tasks such as logging and authorization checks.

### Type Guards
- Implement type guards to differentiate between various user roles and book types.

### Asynchronous Programming
- Handle asynchronous operations for tasks like database queries and sending notifications.

## Getting Started
